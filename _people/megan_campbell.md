## Research Interests
My previous work focused on the overlapping sensorimotor processes underlying interpersonal interactions, within healthy adult cohorts. By using Bayesian models to explain behavioural and neural datasets I described mechanisms for the context-dependent modulation of automatic imitation responses, a feature of how humans prepare responses during interactions with others. Now my focus has shifted to applying this experience in functional neuroimaging, behavioural paradigms and computational approaches to social-emotional cognition and extending this to clinical populations. In particular, I aim to model dynamic brain networks involved in emotion in order to understand, differentiate and improve diagnosis of mood disorders. [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4051-1529)

## Biography
I recently took up my first postdoctoral position here in the Systems Neuroscience Group, Newcastle. This is a continuation of my slow migration south, having grown up in Far North Queensland where I completed a BPsychHons at JCU Cairns, before moving to Brisbane. There I enrolled in a Masters of Neuroscience at the Queensland Brain Institute fell head-over-heals for the field of cognitive neuroscience, and continued on to obtain my PhD in 2019 at UQ.
